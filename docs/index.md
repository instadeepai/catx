# CATX: contextual bandits for continuous actions using trees with smoothing in JAX

CATX is library for training and using a contextual bandits in a continuous action space.


CATX builds on the work presented in the
["Efficient Contextual Bandits with Continuous Actions (CATS)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06040.pdf) paper.
CATX bring forth the freedom to implement custom neural network architectures 
as decision agents within the learning algorithm. It allows for grater scalability and context modalities while
also leveraging the computational speed and efficiency of JAX.
